# Transfinite-Interpolation
This project is about generating grid in circular domain around an ellipse using transfinite interpolation method. 

# To run the code follow the procedure step by step
1. The file format is .py
2. Install the numpy library and matplotlib library in your python interpreter(VS Code) before running it.
3. Load  the python file in the interpreter and run it. Select run without debugging option and then select python debugger.
4  If you just double click it, it will only show the final grid and not the code. So load the file first in the interpreter.
5. Incase of  Google collab , copy and paste the code which is in appendix in report and then run it.
6. The code will gererate the required grid.
